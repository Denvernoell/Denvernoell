    "body": "When Covid hit my city pretty hard, my company descided to switch to remote work in order to mitigate risk. In our office, employees have dual-monitor set ups. To anyone who has never had a dual or tri-monitor set up, try it, you\u0026rsquo;ll like it. Because of this, our boss reccommended getting a second monitor if we did not already have one so that we could mimic our office set up as well as possible. This caused me to scour the internet to find a monitor that was cheap but also fit my needs.\nWhat I found is that used monitors weren\u0026rsquo;t much cheaper than getting a used computer with a monitor. I found a computer with a 24\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; monitor with a small desktop. I went with that option and soon found out that the monitor wasn\u0026rsquo;t super great when it came to quality when using the VGA cable. Then when it came to reimbursement I did not get a reciept because the seller would not give one.\nI watched a video about Linux and he showed how to download Ubuntu. The phrasing that the video used was You can dual-boot if you want but I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend it and don\u0026rsquo;t know why you would want to. So I went all in and erased the Windows 10 from the device and quickly found out that the wifi that was working on Windows, was not working on Ubuntu. After watching 4 different videos showing how to use terminal commands to get access to wifi, I was not successful. This was some of my first usage with the command line.\nThen I watched a video talking about how Linux Mint is the perfect distro to start with. So I switched over to Linux mint and after being unsuccessful with the Wifi on there I figured out how to use the Ethernet cord from my primary desktop to my Linux desktop, since there were no Ethernet connections where I had my computers. I figured out some cool stuff with linux mint and within a few days ended up on Manjaro. Manjaro was cool and all but I watched a video about how to change the startup screen and the poster said that they were using Awesome because it looked cool and they changed it to Awesome, so I changed it to Awesome. Then they rebooted their computer and I rebooted my computer. When my computer rebooted, I found that I had made a mistake and was not able to log back in. Come to find out, I was using xfce and not Awesome. This is something that I did not understand at the time.\nThen I tried out POP! OS. I really liked the look and feel of POP!OS. The keyboard shortcuts were also pretty nifty. They had just come out with a window tiling feature and it exposed me to how that works. This feature also introduced me to having multiple desktops instead of just having everything open on one desktop. After some time I realized that most of the look and feel actually was from Gnome and not POP. I switched back to Manjaro but this time I used the Gnome edition.\n",

    "body": "HTML I watched a video about how to host a website for free with Github Pages. They showed that html5up.net had many templates that could be used and edited for free that actually look really cool. Going to the site I downloaded a couple of the templates and started looking at the HTML. Fun fact, I didn\u0026rsquo;t know HTML at the time. So I watched a crash course to teach me the basics of what different elements were used for and how they affected the website.\nCSS Next was CSS. I also didn\u0026rsquo;t know anything about CSS. Learning about CSS was interesting because it can be daunting if you don\u0026rsquo;t know exactly what you want it to look like.\nJavaScript After that came JavaScript. Took a look at the code for that portion. Still have no Idea what is going on with that.\nGithub Uploading it to a Github Repo did not take much effort although the process is still fairly new to me.\nThis worked for my personal site but when it came to hosting photos for the photo site, file sizes became and issue and I had to look for something that could host large files and files in large quantities\nDomain name Epik\nI personally used Epik because it was recommended by Luke Smith. This process was fairly simple and did not take a whole lot of effort. DNS records: How to point to different sites\nVPS hosting Digital Ocean This part might be the weirdest and most complex part of the whole experience. What a VPS basically does is gives you a server that you have access to that you can upload files to and host your website from them\nThis consisted of:\n Learning how to remote in to a server Sending files from your current computer to a remote server Pointing a custom domain to the hosted server site  ",
