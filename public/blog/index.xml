      <description>When Covid hit my city pretty hard, my company descided to switch to remote work in order to mitigate risk. In our office, employees have dual-monitor set ups. To anyone who has never had a dual or tri-monitor set up, try it, you&amp;rsquo;ll like it. Because of this, our boss reccommended getting a second monitor if we did not already have one so that we could mimic our office set up as well as possible.</description>

They showed that html5up.net had many templates that could be used and edited for free that actually look really cool. Going to the site I downloaded a couple of the templates and started looking at the HTML. Fun fact, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know HTML at the time. So I watched a crash course to teach me the basics of what different elements were used for and how they affected the website.</description>

      <description>Starting my Steel class, I could tell immediately that the problems in this class had lots of opportunity to be programmed due to the reliance on code. This means that any cutting back on referring to the code book can be very beneficial.
