      <description>When Covid hit my city pretty hard, my company descided to switch to remote work in order to mitigate risk. In our office, employees have dual-monitor set ups. To anyone who has never had a dual or tri-monitor set up, try it, you&amp;rsquo;ll like it. Because of this, our boss reccommended getting a second monitor if we did not already have one so that we could mimic our office set up as well as possible.</description>
