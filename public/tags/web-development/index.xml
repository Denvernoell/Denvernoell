      <description>HTML I watched a video about how to host a website for free with Github Pages. They showed that html5up.net had many templates that could be used and edited for free that actually look really cool. Going to the site I downloaded a couple of the templates and started looking at the HTML. Fun fact, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know HTML at the time. So I watched a crash course to teach me the basics of what different elements were used for and how they affected the website.</description>
