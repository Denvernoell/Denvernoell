## Why?

If you have ever put equations into a Word Document you might have been frusturated with your results. In order to create an equation it takes using your keyboard as well as looking through the menus to find Greek symbols and needing to click buttons in order to make subscripts and superscripts.

Luckily within Word, there is the capability to use LaTeX equations.

LaTeX equations may look intimidating but once you break it down into individual parts it becomes relatively simple.

### Basics

| Input       | Output        |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| A_ab        | $A_abc$       |
| A\_{a,b}    | $A_{a,b}$     |
| A^ab        | $A^ab$        |
| A^{a,b}     | $A^{a,b}$     |
| \frac{a}{b} | $\frac{a}{b}$ |
| \pi         | $\pi$         |
| \delta      | $\delta$      |
| \Delta      | $\Delta$      |
